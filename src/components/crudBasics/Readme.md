This CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) example is only for learning purposes. We are building it step by step so you understand the fundamentals.
In real projects, always follow a proper structure and best practices (as I will teach you separately).

=============Before API Integration===============

You Guys must have basic knowledge of the following:

JavaScript (ES6 basics): variables, functions, arrays/objects, async/await

React basics: components, props, state, hooks (useState, useEffect), handling forms

APIs: what is an API and API types , REST methods (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE), status codes

Tools: Postman, Swagger, these tools we use to test Api's before integrationf in our code

Guys you must have concepts about these topics as I was draw diagram in class for you: server, database, and how client communicates with server

We are focusing on RESTful APIs in this CRUD example because they are the most popular and widely used.

CRUD Learning Roadmap

Create (Add data using POST request)

Read (Fetch and display data using GET request)

Update (Modify existing data using PUT or PATCH request)

Delete (Remove data using DELETE request)

Follow this order step by step to clearly understand how CRUD works with RESTful APIs.



BEST OF LUCK
